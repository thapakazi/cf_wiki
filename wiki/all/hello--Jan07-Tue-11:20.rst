`Read the Docs`_ hosts documentation for the open source community. It supports
Sphinx_ docs written with reStructuredText_, and can pull from your Subversion_,
Bazaar_, Git_, and Mercurial_ repositories.

The full documentation is available on `the site`_.

.. _Read the docs: http://readthedocs.org/
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
.. _reStructuredText: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html
.. _Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/
.. _Bazaar: http://bazaar.canonical.com/
.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/
.. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/
.. _the site: http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org

The documentation for the site is organized into two different sections below.
One is for users of readthedocs.org, that is the first section. The next section
is for users of the code that powers the site. All of the RTD code is open
source, so you can run your own instance. Presumably in an internal install
inside your company, or something.
